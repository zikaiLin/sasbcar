Description: The SAS-BCAR package implements a novel prior model for Bayesian scalar-on-image regression, addressing challenges in high-dimensional and limited sample size datasets. Utilizing a binary conditional autoregressive model, SAS-BCAR effectively captures spatial dependencies among feature selection indicators, identifying spatially structured sparsity patterns. This approach allows for adaptive feature selection, accommodating varying spatial dependencies across image regions and enhancing the precision and robustness of statistical inferences in image analysis.
